# SOLID JS

The project relates to [SOLID Principles in JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq13wiqvcTc) course.

SOLID principles do not relate to any specific language and usually are considered in the context of _OOP_. But at the same time they can be applied to _data models_, _functional programming_ and so on. This is because inherently SOLID principles are _abstract_ and are designed to create _scalable systems_.

Within this project SOLID principles are implemented via JavaScript and considered in the context of _OOP_.

To run examples open `solid` folder in terminal of your choice and run `node ${principleFolderName}`.
